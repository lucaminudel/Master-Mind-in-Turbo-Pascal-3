# Master Mind in Turbo Pascal 3
Old Master Mind game implementation in Turbo Pascal 3.0.

You can download the release from here https://github.com/lucaminudel/Master-Mind-in-Turbo-Pascal-3/releases/tag/V1.0 and run it with an online MS-DOS emulator like this: https://virtualconsoles.com/online-emulators/dos/

Current instructions and help file are in Italian and need a translation.
The help file is loaded dynamically but the the instructions on scree need to re-create the executable.
