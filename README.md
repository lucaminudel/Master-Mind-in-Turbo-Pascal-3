Old Master Mind game implementation in Turbo Pascal 3.0.

You can download the release and run it in with an online MS-DOS emulator like this: https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/sys/dos/microsoft/6.22/

Current instructions and help file are in Italian and need a translation.
The help file is loaded dynamically but the the instructions on scree need to re-create the executable.
